## Change Log
Version 7 (current) adds the following features:
* Fixed minor issues

Verison 6 (legacy) adds the following features: 
* Integrated electronics case
* Improved belt drive tensioning scheme

Verison 5 (legacy) adds the following features: 
* mgn rails
* belted drive
* new end effector

Verison 65 (legacy) adds the following features:
* Stepper brake pulley changed to 16 tooth
* Stepper brake mount geometry improved
* Magentetic kinematic coupler changed to bolted kinematic coupler. Magnet will be revisited
* Wire unspooling path components are  now modeled
* Machine now includes all features needed to run comfortably
* Project status updated to beta

Verison 62 (legacy) adds the following features (huge changes):
* Capstan brake changed from rotary damper brake to stepper motor brake via MKS Servo42D driver in torque mode
* All heat set thread inserts removed in favor of plastic screws 
* Redesigned wire end effector Z axis slider for better stability
* Doubled up the coupling magents to hold the end effector on better
* Again: Re-jointed the entire model from step files to clean things up and eliminate worthless dependancies
* Changed workholding strategy to magnetic base plate in tank. Any fixtures you want can be printed and attached with magnets

Verison 59 (legacy) adds the following features:
* Redesigned wire end effector Z axis slider to eliminate the need for milling
* Re-jointed the entire model from step files to clean things up and eliminate worthless dependancies
* Fixed subtle issues with water tank bumper geometry
* .f3d file now available
* Capstan bearings and shaft switched from 1/4" to M6 and 6x12x4 bearing
