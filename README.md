## Concept

* Use components that are readily available worldwide (Amazon.com serving as benchmark)
* 360mm by 500mm footprint and 160mmX; 160mmY; 50mmZ travels
* Use a belted friction drive for wire handling
* Use a integrated driver closed loop stepper in torque mode to tension the wire
* Use inert materials for underwater assemblies
* Implement adjustable worktable for precision
* Use preloaded Tr8x2 nuts with integrated leadscrew steppers and mgn12 rails for motion
* Support the following features via a quick swap kinematic mount:
  * Sinker EDM end effector
  * Hole popper end effector

The firmware and spark generator is a seperate project supplied by

## Disclaimers

**EDM machines are dangerous**  
Beware electric shock and pinch points. Be prepared to activate emergency stop. Do not leave machine unattended. You are responsible for your own safety.

**Metric / Imperial**
The machine is nearly completely metric with the exception of the thickness of the laser cut parts. The nearest metric equivalents should work in all cases, but user should carefully review the CAD model before building to confirm.

## Currently In Progress

* Implement assited self threading

## Future Goals
Future Development:
* Ultra-compact spark generator based on FGPA control technology

## Non-Goals
This is not a spark generator or firmware project, although I do have a high end spark generator under development. This is not an ultra precision machine. This is not a low precision machine.

## Calculations
Desmos calculators have been made for various applications - they are not necessarily complete
